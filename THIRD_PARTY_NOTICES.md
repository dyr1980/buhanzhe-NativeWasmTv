## ijkplayer and FFmpeg

The Android app uses [bilibili/ijkplayer](https://github.com/bilibili/ijkplayer)
`0.8.8`. Its Android native libraries are rebuilt from the corresponding
upstream sources with the small feature profile in `tools/ijk/module-ntv.sh`.
The profile adds RTSP over TCP/UDP and the MP2 audio decoder to the upstream
lite configuration. The Java API continues to use the published 0.8.8 AAR.

License: MIT. See `third_party/crypto-js.LICENSE`.

## JSEncrypt

## Vinyl record artwork

`app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/vinyl_record.png` was redrawn with OpenAI
image generation (2026-09-16): a transparent 653 × 653 black vinyl record
with antialiased edges and a red center label. The visual reference was
**45 rpm record** by Paul Sherman / WP ClipArt, published in the public domain.

The MP3 album cover is drawn over the center at runtime.
